Behavioral nuggets are small, actionable pieces of advice or insights that help people change their behavior or habits in a positive way. Here's a collection of behavioral psychology principles with real-world examples.

## 1. Scarcity

We value things more when they're in limited supply.

**Example:** "Only 2 seats left at this price!" on airline websites, or "Limited time offer" promotions.

---

## 2. Prospect Theory

A loss hurts more than an equal gain feels good.

**Example:** Losing $100 feels more painful than finding $100 feels good. This is why people often prefer a sure $50 over a 50% chance of winning $100.

---

## 3. Framing

We make very different decisions based on how a fact is presented.

**Example:** "90% fat-free" vs "10% fat" - the same information presented differently can lead to different choices.

---

## 4. Self-Expression

We constantly seek out ways to communicate our identity to others.

**Example:** People choosing specific brands of clothing, phones, or cars to signal their values or social status.

---

## 5. Priming

Our decisions are shaped by memories recalled from things just seen or heard.

**Example:** After seeing words related to elderly people, we unconsciously walk slower. Or after seeing luxury items, we might spend more money.

---

## 6. Autonomy Bias

We have a deep-seated need to control our situations.

**Example:** People prefer customizable products (like build-your-own pizzas) even if they end up choosing the same options.

---

## 7. Status Quo Bias

We tend to stick with our previous choices, even if the alternatives might be better.

**Example:** Staying with the same phone carrier or insurance provider even when better deals are available.

---

## 8. Round Pricing Preference

We prefer and trust whole numbers over those ending in a 9.

**Example:** $20 feels more trustworthy than $19.99, even though the difference is minimal.

---

## 9. Center-Stage Effect

We prefer the middle option in a horizontal set of choices.

**Example:** When presented with three subscription tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise), most people choose the middle "Pro" option.

---

## 10. Friction

We're less likely to complete a task with each step added.

**Example:** The more clicks required to complete an online purchase, the more likely people are to abandon their cart.

---

## 11. Boundary Pricing

We're more likely to upgrade if the base price feels closer.

**Example:** When a basic plan is $9.99 and premium is $14.99, people are more likely to upgrade than if the premium was $19.99.

---

## 12. Afterlife Effect

We recycle more when shown what the product will become.

**Example:** Showing how plastic bottles can be transformed into clothing increases recycling rates.

---

## 13. Zeigarnik Effect

Incomplete tasks weigh on our minds until done.

**Example:** Netflix's "Next Episode" autoplay feature keeps us watching because we want to complete the story.

---

## 14. Time Scarcity

We're more likely to act if the clock is ticking.

**Example:** "Flash sales" with countdown timers create urgency and increase purchases.

---

## 15. Surprise Effect

We respond well to positive, unexpected, personal gestures.

**Example:** A hotel leaving a personalized note and small gift in your room creates lasting positive memories.

---

## 16. Storyteller Bias

We're more persuaded by and better recall those who tell stories.

**Example:** Customer testimonials with personal stories are more convincing than statistics alone.

---

## 17. Spacing Effect

We remember things better when repeated over time and across environments.

**Example:** Learning a language through daily short lessons is more effective than cramming.

---

## 18. Segregation Effect

Positive experiences feel better overall when we spread them out.

**Example:** Getting three small raises over a year feels better than one large raise.

---

## 19. Rhyme As Reason Effect

Rhyming statements that you hear, they are seen as more sincere.

**Example:** "A stitch in time saves nine" feels more credible than "Fix things early to prevent bigger problems."

---

## 20. Reciprocity Decay

Our desire to give back wanes rapidly with time.

**Example:** If someone does you a favor, you're more likely to return it immediately than after a long delay.

---

## 21. Product-Person Bias

We look for and value human connections in our products.

**Example:** People prefer products with human-like features or names (like Siri or Alexa).

---

We'll pay more when we smell something nice.

**Example:** Bakeries pumping out fresh bread smells to increase sales in nearby stores.

New or complex ideas are easier understood through existing ones.
