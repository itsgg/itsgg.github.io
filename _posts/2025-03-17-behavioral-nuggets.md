Behavioral nuggets are small, actionable pieces of advice or insights that help people change their behavior or habits in a positive way.

---

## Scarcity

We value things more when they're in limited supply.

**Example:** "Only 2 seats left at this price!" on airline websites, or "Limited time offer" promotions.

---

## Prospect Theory

A loss hurts more than an equal gain feels good.

**Example:** Losing $100 feels more painful than finding $100 feels good. This is why people often prefer a sure $50 over a 50% chance of winning $100.

---

## Framing

We make very different decisions based on how a fact is presented.

**Example:** "90% fat-free" vs "10% fat" - the same information presented differently can lead to different choices.

---

## Self-Expression

We constantly seek out ways to communicate our identity to others.

**Example:** People choosing specific brands of clothing, phones, or cars to signal their values or social status.

---

## Priming

Our decisions are shaped by memories recalled from things just seen or heard.

**Example:** After seeing words related to elderly people, we unconsciously walk slower. Or after seeing luxury items, we might spend more money.

---

## Autonomy Bias

We have a deep-seated need to control our situations.

**Example:** People prefer customizable products (like build-your-own pizzas) even if they end up choosing the same options.

---

## Status Quo Bias

We tend to stick with our previous choices, even if the alternatives might be better.

**Example:** Staying with the same phone carrier or insurance provider even when better deals are available.

---

## Round Pricing Preference

We prefer and trust whole numbers over those ending in a 9.

**Example:** $20 feels more trustworthy than $19.99, even though the difference is minimal.

---

## Center-Stage Effect

We prefer the middle option in a horizontal set of choices.

**Example:** When presented with three subscription tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise), most people choose the middle "Pro" option.

---

## Friction

We're less likely to complete a task with each step added.

**Example:** The more clicks required to complete an online purchase, the more likely people are to abandon their cart.

---

## Boundary Pricing

We're more likely to upgrade if the base price feels closer.

**Example:** When a basic plan is $9.99 and premium is $14.99, people are more likely to upgrade than if the premium was $19.99.

---

## Afterlife Effect

We recycle more when shown what the product will become.

**Example:** Showing how plastic bottles can be transformed into clothing increases recycling rates.

---

## Zeigarnik Effect

Incomplete tasks weigh on our minds until done.

**Example:** Netflix's "Next Episode" autoplay feature keeps us watching because we want to complete the story.

---

## Time Scarcity

We're more likely to act if the clock is ticking.

**Example:** "Flash sales" with countdown timers create urgency and increase purchases.

---

## Surprise Effect

We respond well to positive, unexpected, personal gestures.

**Example:** A hotel leaving a personalized note and small gift in your room creates lasting positive memories.

---

## Storyteller Bias

We're more persuaded by and better recall those who tell stories.

**Example:** Customer testimonials with personal stories are more convincing than statistics alone.

---

## Spacing Effect

We remember things better when repeated over time and across environments.

**Example:** Learning a language through daily short lessons is more effective than cramming.

---

## Segregation Effect

Positive experiences feel better overall when we spread them out.

**Example:** Getting three small raises over a year feels better than one large raise.

---

## Rhyme As Reason Effect

Rhyming statements that you hear, they are seen as more sincere.

**Example:** "A stitch in time saves nine" feels more credible than "Fix things early to prevent bigger problems."

---

## Reciprocity Decay

Our desire to give back wanes rapidly with time.

**Example:** If someone does you a favor, you're more likely to return it immediately than after a long delay.

---

## Product-Person Bias

We look for and value human connections in our products.

**Example:** People prefer products with human-like features or names (like Siri or Alexa).

---

## Picture Superiority Effect

We remember images far better than words.

**Example:** Social media posts with images get more engagement than text-only posts.

---

## Odor Priming

We'll pay more when we smell something nice.

**Example:** Bakeries pumping out fresh bread smells to increase sales in nearby stores.

---

## Metaphorical Shortcut

New or complex ideas are easier understood through existing ones.

**Example:** "The brain is like a computer" helps people understand complex neurological concepts.

---

## Limited Choice

We're more likely to decide when the options are sensibly restricted.

**Example:** A restaurant with 6 main dishes is more likely to get orders than one with 20 options.

---

## IKEA Effect

We'll pay disproportionately more for something we helped create.

**Example:** Build-your-own furniture or custom-designed products feel more valuable.

---

## Hedonic Adaptation

We feel less joy for a gain and discomfort for a loss goes by.

**Example:** The excitement of a new car wears off after a few months, returning to baseline happiness.

---

## Goal Priming

When we're reminded of our aims, we're more motivated to reach them.

**Example:** Vision boards or daily reminders of your goals increase motivation.

**Example:** Loyalty cards that come pre-stamped with some points to get you started.

---

## Devil Effect

Our perception of a single negative attribute unfairly bleeds into other unrelated areas.

**Example:** A person's poor punctuality might lead others to question their overall competence.

---

## Decoy Effect

We're more likely to buy B over A by adding C to make B look more attractive.

**Example:** Adding a third, less attractive option to make the middle option seem like the best value.

---

## Contrast Effect

We better remember products that stand out from their surroundings.

**Example:** A bright red car in a parking lot of white cars is more memorable.

---

## Competition

We strive with and against one another for limited resources and status.

**Example:** Leaderboards in fitness apps or games increase engagement.

---

## Anchoring

What we see first affects our judgment of everything thereafter.

**Example:** The first price you see for a product influences how you value it.

---

## Fast & Slow Thinking

We make knee-jerk spontaneous decisions that can cause regretful damage.

**Example:** Impulse buying or sending angry emails without thinking.

---

## Dynamic Norms

We're more likely to change if we can see a new behavior developing.

**Example:** Seeing increasing numbers of people using reusable bags encourages others to do the same.

## Salience

Our choices are determined by the information we're shown.

**Example:** Products placed at eye level in stores sell better than those on lower shelves.

We tend to favor our group over others.

**Example:** Supporting your local sports team even when they're not playing well.

---

## If-Then Plans

If in this scenario, we then plan to do that, we'll more likely to reach our goals.

---

## Temptation Bundling

We're more likely to do the hard stuff when coupled with the pleasant.

**Example:** Only allowing yourself to watch your favorite show while exercising.

What we want now is often the opposite of what we aspire to in the future.
