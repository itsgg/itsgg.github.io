Mindfulness is simply paying full attention to what's happening around you and inside you, in the present moment, without any judgement.

## Find a Quiet Spot

Choose a peaceful place where you won't be disturbed. It can be indoors or outdoors.

---

## Get Comfortable

Sit or lie down in a comfortable position. You can sit on a chair, cushion, or on the floor. Keep your back straight to prevent drowsiness.

---

## Close Your Eyes

Gently close your eyes or lower your gaze to reduce visual distractions.

---

## Focus on Your Breath

Pay attention to your breathing. Notice the sensation of air entering and leaving your nostrils, or the rise and fall of your belly.

---

## Notice when Your Mind Wanders

It's natural for your mind to wander. When you notice this happening, gently redirect your attention back to your breath.

---

## Don't Judge Your Thoughts

Try not to judge your thoughts or get involved with them. Simply observe them as they come and go.

---

## Stay in the Moment

Keep bringing your focus back to the present. Notice any sounds, smells, or sensations you're experiencing.

---

## Start with short Sessions

Begin with 5-10 minutes a day and gradually increase the duration as you get more comfortable with the practice.

---

## Be Patient

Mindfulness takes practice. Don't be hard on yourself if you find it challenging at first.
