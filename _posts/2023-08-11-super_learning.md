## Fertile Conditions

- Work with pre-existing, inbuilt mechanisms we all already possess.
  - Work with rather than against the brain.
- The human attention span is limited.
  - Digest new information in smaller, more manageable chunks.
- Learning period should be more than 30 minutes, and less than 50 minutes.
  - Too short, you will not get into any depth.
  - Too long, your cognitive powers will begin to fatigue.
- Use your time wisely.
  - Plan ahead.
  - Designate times in your schedule for specific learning blocks.
- Use concept learning.
  - Prioritize understanding and comprehension over rote memorization. (Concepts before facts)
  - When you learn deep rather than surface, you anchor new ideas in context and make it easier to remember and apply them.
- Engage in deliberate productive failure.
  - Failures can be a valuable source of information.
- Challenge yourself without frustrating yourself.
  - Look closely at why things happened as they did.
  - Ask yourself why you failed and think about how you could have done better.
- Cultivate growth mindset.
  - Assume that learning is uncomfortable sometimes.
  - Failure is part of learning.
  - Use failure to inspire you to make new plans for going forward.
- Expect frustration, but don't succumb to it.
  - Failure is something that brings you closer to success, not further from it.

## Memory Retention

- Learning relies on memory.
  - Memory is an interplay of storing and retrieving information.
- The three main steps of memory are
  1. Encoding
  2. Storing
  3. Retrieval
- How well we encode depends on
  - The degree and intensity of attention we pay.
  - The senses through which we encounter it.
  - Our associated emotions.
- We store memories as
  - Transient sensory memory.
  - Short-term memory.
  - Long-term memory.
- Retrieval is when we return to stored memories and pull them out again.  
  - We can recall it directly.  
  - We can recognise it.  
  - Remembering after a cue.  
  - Relearning.  
  - Least effecting/lasting method.
- Forgetting occurs on a forgetting curve.
  - When we rehearse, we refresh the memory.
  - The rate of decay slows enough to say something is permanent.
- The study cycle is a process to follow to maximise your learning process.
  - The steps are
    - Preview.
    - Attend.
    - Review.
    - Study.
    - Assess.
  - Flow through each step consciously, establishing context, paying attention, actively reading and engaging, drilling the material and then taking time to assess.
- Retrieval practice cements the memories most.
  - Active process.
  - Instills memory firmly.
- Spaced repetition is most effect for practicing retrieval and countering forgetting.
  - Deliberate practice can enhance your learning and knowledge over time.

## Active Learning

- Conventional study techniques are poor at helping use learn.
  - Summarising, highlighting, mnemonics, imagery to text, and re-reading.
  - These can be useful in limited contexts.
- Active and applied techniques are more effective.
  - Practice testing, distributed practice, elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice.
- Elaborative interrogation.
  - We use questions to ensure a depth understanding of the material.
  - Asking "why" and "how" reveals casual connections.
  - This aids in memory apart from learning.
- Self-explanation.
  - Forces us to delve more deeply into concepts.
  - We "teach ourselves" and identify gaps in understanding.
  - By explaining ideas, sequences or concepts to yourself, you learn them "from inside out".
- Richard Feynman technique.
  - Check your comprehension by seeing whether you can explain any idea in simple, straightforward language.
  - If you can't, there are conceptual gaps or misunderstanding.
- Interleaved practice.
  - Encourages you to alternate between different topics or skills in a single study session.
  - You develop cognitive agility and strengthen connections.
- Active learning works the best when chosen for its appropriateness for the particular student, topic, and lesson at hand.

## Learning Secondary

- Act in such a way that it doesn't feel like you're learning at all.
  - If you make learning secondary, you learn more quickly and easily.
- We are more likely to reach our specific goals when we are driven by a deeper and more comprehensive desire to understand what we're learning.
  - Six facets of learning.
    1. Explanation (Why does XYZ happen?).
    2. Interpretation (How can this data be changed from form X into form Y?).
    3. Application (What can I actually do with this knowledge?).
    4. Perspective (What other way can I look at this?).
    5. Empathy (How is that other person looking at it?).
    6. Self-knowledge (Who am I?).
- If we can tap into our most powerful motivation to understand the material in front of us, we can find energy, enthusiasm and comprehension for our studies.
- Problem-based learning is a way of focusing on the real-world application of knowledge.
  - This engages us in the practical world of problem and solution, cause and effect.
  - We become engrossed because we want to keep acquiring mastery and skills.
- Gamification is a way to make learning fun and almost accidental.
  - It uses gaming principles in a non-gaming context.
  - They work best when
    - The rules are clear.
    - There is an obvious and linear progress from step to step.
    - Rewards are immediate and proportional.
  - Gamification is great for supplementing exhausted motivation.
  - It makes everyday study more fun and enjoyable.
  - It can't, however, completely replace a deeper motivation or purpose.

## Teaching to Learn

- Tackling the learning question from the teacher's point of view enriches your own understanding.
  - It gives you a firmer grasp on the things you yourself are eager to learn better.
  - In the Learning Pyramid, activities that are most active, hands-on and teaching-focused end up being the most effective.
- The protégé effect explains how tutors who teach others invariably perform better than students who don't also teach.
  - They learn in more organized increments.
  - Can detach their ego more thoroughly from failure and experimentation.
  - Take on more responsibility for active learning.
- Good feedback is an essential part of the learning process.
  - Learning to give and take good feedback is part of gaining mastery in any subject.
  - Good feedback is specific, given as quickly as possible, and tied to a concrete goal.
  - Use tact and awareness, understanding that people learn better when they feel supported and praised.
  - Tailor your feedback to your student's personality, learning style and degree of mastery.
- Deep information processing is about engaging with data beyond the superficial.
  - We can see into its meaning and significance.
- Metacognition consists of two modes, thinking and thinking about thinking.
  - Learning is best when it switches between these two modes.
  - Encourage metacognition through the use of self-questing.
    - Ask question before, during and after learning to shape, guide and enrich our comprehension.
- PQ4R brings metacognition to your reading.
  - Preview.
  - Question.
  - Read.
  - Reflect.
  - Recite.
  - Review.

## Mistakes in Learning

- We can work to dismantle bad habit that undermine our learning.
- Avoid lazy reading, where we don't actively engage with the material.
  - Learning how to read is as important as learning what to read.
- Our attitudes and perspectives can play an enormous role in how well we learn.
  - How resilient are we to challenges and adversities.
  - A fixed mindset is one in which we think knowledge and skill are inborn and can't be learned.
  - A growth mindset sees development as possible, and achieved through effort and focus.
- Learning style doesn't have any scientific evidence.
  - We all have preferences.
  - The brain is designed to take in data in a variety of formats, using all our senses.
  - Our learning improves when we draw on as many of these as possible.
- Adapt your learning process in terms of "mind styles".
  - Perceptual quality.
    - Abstract vs. concrete.
  - Ordering ability.
    - Sequential vs. random.
  - These produce four types, with different preferences for encountering new information.
- Lazy note-taking is passive instead of active and does not produce lasting change.
  - Use Cornell notes, with a column each for notes, cue and summary, so that you can engage more closely with the material.
- A good note-taking strategy comprises note-taking, note editing, note analysis and note reflection.
  - Notes become a living reflection of your process, rather than something that's inert and quickly forgotten.
- Learning is trial and error, what works for one person in one context might not for another person in another context.
  - It's all about consciously observing, adjusting and appraising your own process as you go, and empowering yourself to make incremental improvements.
