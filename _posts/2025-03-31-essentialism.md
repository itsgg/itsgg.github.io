Essentialism emphasizes focusing only on what's absolutely necessary, eliminating non-essential distractions to achieve greater productivity, clarity, and fulfillment. It advocates disciplined pursuit of fewer but better choices.

## Concepts

### Discernment

Carefully distinguishing the vital few tasks or activities from the trivial many, to maximize effectiveness and satisfaction.

### Elimination

Actively removing non-essential tasks, activities, and commitments to concentrate efforts on truly important tasks.

### Boundaries

Clearly defining and maintaining limits to protect essential priorities, time, and energy.

### Time Blocking
