Identify and actively challenge distorted negative thoughts, replacing them with balanced, realistic alternatives.

### Behavioral Activation

Increase engagement with positive, rewarding activities to counteract avoidance behaviors and low motivation.

Systematically and gradually expose oneself to anxiety-provoking stimuli to reduce feare responses and anxiety over time.
