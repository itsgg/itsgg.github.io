Learn how to craft clear, precise, and effective prompts to get the most accurate and valuable responses from AI models.

## 1. Clarity and Precision

### Be Clear and Specific

Avoid ambiguity in your query.

- **Bad**: "Tell me something about startups."
- **Good**: "What are the top challenges faced by early-stage SaaS startups and how to overcome them?"

### Include Necessary Context

Provide details relevant to your request.

- **Example**: "I’m building a hyperlocal social networking app. What marketing strategies should I focus on to acquire users in small neighborhoods?"

---

## 2. Break Down Complex Questions

### Divide Large Queries into Smaller Parts

Split large or multi-part questions into smaller, manageable parts.

- **Instead of**: "What’s a good tech stack for my app and how can I monetize it?"
- **Ask**:
  - "What tech stack would you recommend for building a scalable hyperlocal app?"
  - "What are some monetization strategies for hyperlocal platforms?"

---

## 3. Specify the Output Format

### Request a Structured Response

Tell me how you want the answer to be presented:

- **Examples**:
  - “Provide the answer in bullet points.”
  - “List the steps in a structured format.”
  - “Summarize this into 100 words.”
  - “Give me a table comparing X and Y.”

---

## 4. Provide Context or Background

### Share Relevant Details

Give me relevant details about your goals, audience, or existing work.

- **Example**: “I’m a software architect building a social network for students. Suggest features that focus on collaborative learning.”

---

## 5. Define Constraints or Boundaries

### Set Limits for the Response

Tell me any limits to follow for a more relevant response.

- **Examples**:
  - “Explain this in simple terms for beginners.”
  - “Focus only on examples from India.”
  - “Limit the explanation to 200 words.”

---

## 6. Iterative Refinement

### Improve Responses with Follow-Ups

If the response isn’t what you expected:

- **Clarify further**: “Focus more on X and less on Y.”
- **Reframe the question**: “I was actually looking for examples of successful AI-based platforms.”

---

## 7. Ask for Examples or Use Cases

### Request Real-World Applications

If applicable, ask for real-world applications or scenarios.

- **Example**: “Give examples of how AI is being used in hyperlocal discovery apps.”

---

## 8. Request Step-by-Step Instructions

### Ask for a Process Breakdown

For processes or tutorials, request a breakdown.

- **Example**: “Explain step-by-step how to set up a MongoDB database with Express.js.”

---

## 9. Ask for Comparisons

### Compare Options or Approaches

If you’re exploring options, request a comparison.

- **Example**: “Compare the pros and cons of React vs. Angular for a mobile-first web app.”

---

## 10. Define the Tone and Depth

### Specify the Desired Style

Specify how detailed or simple you want the response.

- **Examples**:
  - “Keep it concise and to the point.”
  - “Explain in-depth with technical details.”
  - “Make it suitable for a non-technical audience.”

---

## 11. Provide Examples for Clarity

### Show What You’re Looking For

If you want a certain style, format, or type of answer, share an example.

- **Example**: “Explain it like this: [insert example].”

---

## 12. Use “Do Not” Clauses

### Avoid Unwanted Details

If you want me to avoid something, mention it.

- **Example**: “Explain this without using too much jargon.”

---

## Prompt Formula: Who + What + How/Why + Context/Constraints

### Key Components

1. **Who**: Who is the target audience?
2. **What**: What do you want to know?
3. **How/Why**: What style, format, or depth do you want?
4. **Context/Constraints**: Relevant details, limits, or examples.
