Understanding time complexity and space complexity is fundamental to writing efficient, scalable code. This guide explores Big-O notation and common complexity patterns through practical examples and real-world analogies.

## Introduction

Before diving into specific complexities, let's understand **Big-O Notation**, which provides a high-level abstraction of both time and space complexity.

### Understanding Big-O

Big-O notation helps us analyze algorithms in terms of their scalability and efficiency. It answers the question: "How does the performance or space requirements grow as the input size grows?, focusing on the worst-case scenario."

```
Impact:    Operations for n=5:      Visualization:
-------    -----------------      ---------------
O(1)       1                     ▏        Excellent!
O(log n)   2                     ▎        Great!
O(n)       5                     ▍        Good
O(n log n) 11                    █        Fair
O(n²)      25                    ████     Poor
O(2ⁿ)      32                    █████    Bad
O(n!)      120                   ████████ Terrible!
```

#### Key Characteristics

1. **Focuses on Growth Rate**
   - Ignores constants and smaller terms
   - O(2n) is simplified to O(n)
   - O(n² + n) is simplified to O(n²)

2. **Worst-Case Scenario**
   - Represents upper bound of growth
   - Helps in planning for the worst situation
   - Example: Linear search worst case is O(n), even though it might find the element immediately

3. **Asymptotic Behavior**
   - Considers behavior with large inputs
   - Small input differences become irrelevant
   - Important for scalability analysis

#### Common Rules

1. **Drop Constants**

   ```ruby
   # O(2n) → O(n)
   array.each { |x| puts x }  # First loop
   array.each { |x| puts x }  # Second loop
   ```

2. **Drop Lower Order Terms**

   ```ruby
   # O(n² + n) → O(n²)
   array.each do |x|        # O(n)
    array.each do |y|      # O(n²)
      puts x + y
    end
   end
   ```

3. **Different Variables**
   ```ruby
   # O(n * m) - cannot be simplified if n ≠ m
   array1.each do |x|
     array2.each do |y|
       puts x + y
     end
   end
   ```

#### Practical Examples

1. **Constant Time - O(1)**

   ```ruby
   def get_first(array)
     array[0]   # Always one operation
   end
   ```

2. **Linear Time - O(n)**

   ```ruby
   def sum_array(array)
     sum = 0
     array.each { |x| sum += x }  # Operations grow linearly
     sum
   end
   ```

3. **Quadratic Time - O(n²)**
   ```ruby
   def nested_loops(array)
     array.each do |x|
       array.each do |y|    # Nested loop creates quadratic growth
         puts x + y
       end
     end
   end
   ```

#### Common Misconceptions

1. **Big-O is Not Exact Time**
   - O(1) doesn't mean "instant"
   - O(n²) might be faster than O(n) for small inputs
   - It's about growth rate, not absolute performance

2. **Constants Do Matter in Practice**
   - While O(100n) simplifies to O(n)
   - The constant 100 still affects real-world performance
   - Use Big-O for high-level comparison, not micro-optimization
3. **Best Case vs Average Case**
   - Big-O typically shows worst case
   - Quick Sort: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case
   - Consider your use case when choosing algorithms

#### Comparing Growth Rates

From fastest to slowest growth:

1. O(1) - Constant
2. O(log n) - Logarithmic
3. O(n) - Linear
4. O(n log n) - Linearithmic
5. O(n²) - Quadratic
6. O(2ⁿ) - Exponential
7. O(n!) - Factorial

For example, with n = 1000:

- O(log n) ≈ 10 operations
- O(n) = 1,000 operations
- O(n²) = 1,000,000 operations

## Time Complexity

Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input grows.

### Common Time Complexities

| **Complexity** | **Description**                                   | **Real-World Analogy**                | **Example Algorithm**       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| O(1)           | Constant time, independent of input size          | Accessing the first locker in a row | Accessing an array by index |
| O(log n)       | Logarithmic growth, halves input at each step     | Finding a name in a phone book      | Binary Search               |
| O(n)           | Linear growth, proportional to input size         | Reading every book on a shelf       | Linear Search               |
| O(n log n)     | Linearithmic growth, efficient divide-and-conquer | Sorting multiple card decks         | Merge Sort, Quick Sort      |
| O(n²)          | Quadratic growth, nested comparisons              | Comparing all students in a class   | Bubble Sort, Selection Sort |
| O(2ⁿ)          | Exponential growth, doubles with each new element | Trying all combinations of a lock   | Generate all subsets        |
| O(n!)          | Factorial growth, all possible arrangements       | Arranging people in all orders      | Generate all permutations   |

### Common Algorithm Examples

#### O(1) - Constant Time

- **Definition**: The algorithm's runtime does not depend on the input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Picking the first book on a shelf takes the same time whether there are 5 or 500 books.

##### Ruby Code Example

```ruby
def first_element(array)
  array[0] # Accessing an element by index is O(1)
end

puts first_element([1, 2, 3]) # => 1
```

##### Execution Steps

```
Array: [1, 2, 3]
         ↓
Access:  1  2  3
         ↑
Result:  1
```

---

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows logarithmically as the input size increases, typically in divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- **Real-World Example**: Searching for a name in a sorted phone book by repeatedly halving the search range.

##### Ruby Code Example: Binary Search

```ruby
def binary_search(array, target)
  low, high = 0, array.length - 1

  while low <= high
    mid = (low + high) / 2
    return mid if array[mid] == target

    array[mid] < target ? low = mid + 1 : high = mid - 1
  end

  -1 # Return -1 if not found
end

puts binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) # => 2
```

##### Execution Steps: Searching for 3 in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
Step 1:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    Initial array
          L     M     H      L=0, M=2, H=4

         [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    Check M=3
              ↑
              Found!        Target found at index 2
```

---

#### O(n) - Linear Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows linearly with the input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Finding a specific book on a shelf by checking each book sequentially.

##### Ruby Code Example: Linear Search

```ruby
def linear_search(array, target)
  array.each_with_index do |element, index|
    return index if element == target
  end
  -1
end

puts linear_search([5, 3, 8, 6], 8) # => 2
```

##### Execution Steps: Searching for 8 in [5, 3, 8, 6]

```
Step 1:  [5, 3, 8, 6]    Check 5
          ↑
          x

Step 2:  [5, 3, 8, 6]    Check 3
             ↑
             x

Step 3:  [5, 3, 8, 6]    Check 8
                ↑
                ✓         Found at index 2!
```

---

#### O(n²) - Quadratic Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows quadratically with input size due to nested iterations.
- **Real-World Example**: Comparing every student in a classroom to every other student to find matching handwriting.

##### Ruby Code Example: Bubble Sort

```ruby
def bubble_sort(array)
  n = array.length
  (0...n).each do |i|
    (0...(n - i - 1)).each do |j|
      if array[j] > array[j + 1]
        array[j], array[j + 1] = array[j + 1], array[j]
      end
    end
  end
  array
end

puts bubble_sort([5, 3, 8, 6]) # => [3, 5, 6, 8]
```

##### Execution Steps: Sorting [5, 3, 8, 6]

```
Pass 1:  [5, 3, 8, 6]    Compare 5,3
          ↑ ↑
         [3, 5, 8, 6]    Swap!

         [3, 5, 8, 6]    Compare 5,8
             ↑ ↑
         [3, 5, 8, 6]    No swap

         [3, 5, 8, 6]    Compare 8,6
                ↑ ↑
         [3, 5, 6, 8]    Swap!

Pass 2:  [3, 5, 6, 8]    Compare 3,5
          ↑ ↑
         [3, 5, 6, 8]    No swap

         [3, 5, 6, 8]    Compare 5,6
             ↑ ↑
         [3, 5, 6, 8]    No swap

Final:   [3, 5, 6, 8]    Sorted!
```

---

#### O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows faster than O(n) but slower than O(n²), often in divide-and-conquer sorting.
- **Real-World Example**: Sorting cards by repeatedly dividing and merging groups.

##### Ruby Code Example: Merge Sort

```ruby
def merge_sort(array)
  return array if array.length <= 1

  mid = array.length / 2
  left = merge_sort(array[0...mid])
  right = merge_sort(array[mid..])

  merge(left, right)
end

def merge(left, right)
  result = []
  while left.any? && right.any?
    result << (left.first <= right.first ? left.shift : right.shift)
  end
  result + left + right
end

puts merge_sort([5, 3, 8, 6]) # => [3, 5, 6, 8]
```

##### Execution Steps: Sorting [5, 3, 8, 6]

```
Split:   [5, 3, 8, 6]        Original array
           /        \        Split into two
      [5, 3]      [8, 6]    
       /  \        /  \     Split again
    [5]  [3]    [8]  [6]    Individual elements

Merge:   [5]  [3]    [8]  [6]    Start merging
         \   /        \   /      Compare & merge pairs
        [3, 5]      [6, 8]      
            \        /          Final merge
         [3, 5, 6, 8]          Sorted array!
```

---

#### O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows exponentially, doubling with each additional element.
- **Real-World Example**: Finding all possible combinations of items in a set.

##### Ruby Code Example: Generate All Subsets

```ruby
def generate_subsets(array)
  return [[]] if array.empty?
  
  element = array[0]
  subsets_without = generate_subsets(array[1..-1])
  subsets_with = subsets_without.map { |subset| subset + [element] }
  
  subsets_without + subsets_with
end

puts generate_subsets([1, 2, 3]).inspect
```

##### Execution Steps: Generating subsets of [1, 2]

```
Input: [1, 2]

Step 1:   []              Start with empty set
          |
Step 2:   [] → [1]        Add 1 to empty set
          |
Step 3:   [] → [1]        Add 2 to each previous set
          |    |
          [2]  [1,2]

Results:  []              All possible subsets
          [1]             ↑
          [2]             Total: 2ⁿ = 4 subsets
          [1,2]           ↓
```

---

#### O(n!) - Factorial Time

- **Definition**: The runtime grows with the factorial of the input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Finding all possible arrangements of items.

##### Ruby Code Example: Generate All Permutations

```ruby
def generate_permutations(array)
  return [array] if array.length <= 1
  
  permutations = []
  array.each_with_index do |element, index|
    remaining = array[0...index] + array[index + 1..-1]
    generate_permutations(remaining).each do |perm|
      permutations << [element] + perm
    end
  end
  
  permutations
end

puts generate_permutations([1, 2, 3]).inspect
```

##### Execution Steps: Generating permutations of [1, 2, 3]

```
Input: [1, 2, 3]

Level 1:     [1]       [2]       [3]       Choose first number
              |         |         |
Level 2:    [2,3]     [1,3]     [1,2]     Arrange remaining
             / \       / \       / \
Level 3: [2,3] [3,2] [1,3] [3,1] [1,2] [2,1]

Results:  [1,2,3]  →  [2,1,3]  →  [3,1,2]   All permutations
          [1,3,2]  →  [2,3,1]  →  [3,2,1]   Total: 3! = 6
```

## Space Complexity

While time complexity focuses on execution speed, space complexity measures memory usage. Understanding both is essential for writing efficient algorithms.

Space complexity consists of two main components:

1. **Input Space**: Memory required to store the input data
2. **Auxiliary Space**: Additional memory used during computation

### Common Space Complexities

| **Complexity** | **Description**                       | **Real-World Analogy**              | **Example Algorithm**     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| O(1)           | Constant space, no extra memory       | Using a calculator for addition     | Swapping variables        |
| O(log n)       | Logarithmic space for recursion       | Stack of cards in binary search     | Quick Sort, Binary Search |
| O(n)           | Linear space for auxiliary structures | Making a copy of a deck of cards    | Merge Sort                |
| O(n²)          | Quadratic space for nested tables     | Chess board with all possible moves | Dynamic Programming (2D)  |

### Common Algorithm Examples

#### O(1) - Constant Space

- **Definition**: The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Using a calculator to add numbers - it needs the same memory whether adding small or large numbers.

##### Ruby Code Example: Number Swap

```ruby
def swap_numbers(a, b)
  temp = a    # One extra variable regardless of input size
  a = b
  b = temp
  [a, b]
end

puts swap_numbers(5, 3).inspect # => [3, 5]
```

##### Memory Analysis for O(1)
- **Input Space**: Two variables (a, b)
- **Auxiliary Space**: One temporary variable (temp)
- **Total**: O(1) - constant space

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Space

- **Definition**: The algorithm's memory usage grows logarithmically with input size, often due to recursive call stack.
- **Real-World Example**: Using a stack of cards in binary search, where we only track the middle card at each step.

##### Ruby Code Example: Recursive Binary Search

```ruby
def binary_search_recursive(array, target, low = 0, high = array.length - 1)
  return -1 if low > high

  mid = (low + high) / 2
  return mid if array[mid] == target

  if array[mid] < target
    binary_search_recursive(array, target, mid + 1, high)
  else
    binary_search_recursive(array, target, low, mid - 1)
  end
end

puts binary_search_recursive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3) # => 2
```

##### Memory Analysis for O(log n)
- **Input Space**: Array and target value
- **Auxiliary Space**: Recursive call stack (log n levels deep)
- **Total**: O(log n) space

#### O(n) - Linear Space

- **Definition**: The algorithm's memory usage grows linearly with input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Making a copy of a deck of cards - you need space proportional to the number of cards.

##### Ruby Code Example: Merge Sort (Space Focus)

```ruby
def merge_sort_space_example(array)
  return array if array.length <= 1

  mid = array.length / 2
  left = array[0...mid].clone    # O(n/2) space
  right = array[mid..].clone     # O(n/2) space

  # Total O(n) auxiliary space used
  merge(merge_sort_space_example(left),
        merge_sort_space_example(right))
end

puts merge_sort_space_example([5, 3, 8, 6]).inspect # => [3, 5, 6, 8]
```

##### Memory Analysis for O(n)
- **Input Space**: Original array
- **Auxiliary Space**: Two subarrays of size n/2
- **Total**: O(n) space

#### O(n²) - Quadratic Space

- **Definition**: The algorithm's memory usage grows quadratically with input size.
- **Real-World Example**: Creating a chess board where each square stores all possible moves from that position.

##### Ruby Code Example: All Pairs Shortest Path

```ruby
def floyd_warshall(graph)
  n = graph.length
  # Create n×n distance matrix
  dist = Array.new(n) { |i| Array.new(n) { |j| graph[i][j] } }

  n.times do |k|
    n.times do |i|
      n.times do |j|
        if dist[i][k] && dist[k][j] &&
           (dist[i][j].nil? || dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j])
          dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
        end
      end
    end
  end
  dist
end

graph = [
  [0, 5, nil, 10],
  [nil, 0, 3, nil],
  [nil, nil, 0, 1],
  [nil, nil, nil, 0]
]
puts floyd_warshall(graph).inspect
```

##### Memory Analysis for O(n²)
- **Input Space**: Original n×n graph
- **Auxiliary Space**: n×n distance matrix
- **Total**: O(n²) space

### Space Complexity Examples

#### O(1) - Constant Space

- **Definition**: Uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of input size.
- **Example**: In-place array element swap

```ruby
def swap_elements(array, i, j)
  temp = array[i]
  array[i] = array[j]
  array[j] = temp
end
```

#### O(log n) - Logarithmic Space

- **Definition**: Memory usage grows logarithmically with input size.
- **Example**: Recursive binary search call stack

  return -1 if low > high
  mid = (low + high) / 2
  return mid if array[mid] == target
  array[mid] < target ? binary_search_recursive(array, target, mid + 1, high) :

Total Space: O(log n) stack frames
```

#### O(n) - Linear Space

- **Definition**: Memory usage grows linearly with input size.
- **Example**: Creating a reversed copy of an array

```ruby
def reverse_copy(array)
  result = Array.new(array.length)
  array.each_with_index { |elem, i| result[array.length - 1 - i] = elem }
  result
end
```

def create_distance_matrix(vertices)
  Array.new(vertices.length) { |i|
    Array.new(vertices.length) { |j|
      calculate_distance(vertices[i], vertices[j])
    }

### Summary and Best Practices

| **Space Complexity** | **Best Used When**                 | **Trade-offs**                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| O(1)                 | Memory is very limited             | May need more computation time |
| O(log n)             | Balanced memory-speed needs        | Good for large datasets        |
| O(n)                 | Speed is priority over memory      | Acceptable for most cases      |
| O(n²)                | Problem requires storing all pairs | Only for small inputs          |

## Conclusion

Understanding both time and space complexity is crucial for writing efficient algorithms. While time complexity helps optimize execution speed, space complexity ensures efficient memory usage. The key is finding the right balance based on your specific requirements:

1. For memory-constrained environments, prioritize space complexity
2. For performance-critical applications, focus on time complexity
3. For balanced applications, consider algorithms with reasonable trade-offs (like O(n log n) time with O(n) space)

Remember that these are theoretical measures, and real-world performance can be affected by factors like:

- Hardware capabilities
- Input data patterns
- Implementation details
- System load
